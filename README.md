# TeslaVSGamestop

This project is based on Python Libraries (Beautiful soup, pandas, yfinance, plotly). 
In this we scraped the websites 
1. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue
2. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue
 
We made a soup of them and tried to work with their revenue.
Firstly we installed the data using <b>yfinance</b> then created a soup using <b>BeautifulSoup</b>.
Using that soup and <b>Pandas library</b> we cleaned the data and then used 
<b>Plotly's</b> <i>make_graph</i> to see the ups and downs in the stock of Tesla and GameStop.

It was the project of IBM's Data Science Course.
